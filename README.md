 car rental web services in PHP
PHP-centered project I'm working on for a certain car rental company, a complete website written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and some Javascript, that lists cars, allows for reservations, shows the status, has various features based on each car's availability, utilizes an API, has an admin interface to edit cars, approve reservations, changes availability, and so much more.
Responsively designed CSS. Includes some tailwind and incorporates fancy bits of javascript.
SQLite is utilized for the backend.
I am also responsible for the deployment; I host the website on a Debian virtual machine I manage, configured with nginx to serve the content effectively and in accordance to modern security standards.

TODO: docker image to simplify deployment, javascript to improve user experience.
