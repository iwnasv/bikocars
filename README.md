 car rental web services in PHP
This is a project I did in PHP for a car rental company, a complete website written in PHP that lists cars, allows for reservations, shows the status, has various features based on each car's availability, utilizes an API, has an admin interface to edit cars, approve reservations, changes availability.
Responsively designed in CSS, includes some tailwind and incorporates fancy bits of javascript. It's my first professional effort, and a project I'm still working on.

I am also responsible for the deployment; I host the website on a Debian virtual machine, configured with nginx and sqlite to serve the content effectively and in accordance to modern security standards.
